            <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
            <p>Yellow set out to tackle one of India’s most pressing yet overlooked problems: succession planning. With
                billions of dollars lying unclaimed and countless families navigating a system riddled with
                inefficiencies and corruption, Yellow aimed to provide a seamless, digital-first solution for users to
                create a living will. However, before my arrival as CTO, the startup was struggling—burning money on an
                external software agency that failed to deliver a robust product.</p>
            <p>In just 6–8 months, I built an in-house engineering team, inherited a subpar codebase, re-architected the
                entire tech stack, and successfully launched a Flutter-based mobile app along with a fully functional
                web app. This case study details how we executed this turnaround.</p>

            <h1 class="title">The Challenge: A Dysfunctional Development Process</h1>
            <p>Before I joined, Yellow relied on an outsourced software agency that failed to deliver a scalable,
                maintainable product. Key challenges included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Poor Code Quality:</span> The Flutter app had been built with an inconsistent architecture,
                    leading to frequent crashes and performance bottlenecks.</li>
                <li><span>Backend Scalability Issues: </span>The Node.js backend was monolithic, poorly structured, and
                    lacked proper security and efficiency optimizations.</li>
                <li><span>Frontend Limitations:</span> The React-based web app was fragmented, with a lack of reusable
                    components and proper state management.</li>
                <li><span>High Burn, Low Output:</span> Despite significant investments, the agency's deliverables were
                    slow, unoptimized, and required constant rework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1 class="title">The Turnaround: Building an In-House Team & Re-Architecting the Stack</h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Step 1: Assembling a Lean Engineering Team</h2>
            <p>I hired a small team of young, highly motivated engineers who were eager to build something meaningful.
                By bringing development in-house, we reduced dependencies on third-party vendors and gained full control
                over the technology.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Step 2: Rebuilding the Flutter App</h2>
            <p>One of the first tasks was to overhaul the Flutter app. The previous implementation had fragmented state
                management, redundant widgets, and inefficient API handling.</p>
            <h3>Key Improvements:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Adopted a Clean Architecture:</span> Implemented a layered architecture following Flutter's
                    best practices (Presentation, Domain, Data layers) to improve scalability.
                </li>
                <li><span>State Management Overhaul:</span> Moved to Riverpod for efficient state management, reducing
                    unnecessary rebuilds and improving performance.</li>
                <li><span>Optimized API Calls: </span>Implemented caching mechanisms and batch API requests to reduce
                    latency.
                </li>
                <li><span>Security Enhancements: </span> Integrated secure authentication and encrypted local storage to
                    protect sensitive user data.
                </li>

            <h1 class="title">Step 3: Revamping the Node.js Backend</h1>
            <p>The inherited Node.js backend was inefficient, making data retrieval slow and resource-intensive. We
                restructured it into a modular, scalable system.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Key Improvements:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Microservices Architecture: </span>Broke the monolithic backend into independent, scalable
                    services.
                </li>
                <li><span>Database Optimization: </span>Implemented indexing and query optimization for faster
                    retrieval.</li>
                <li><span>Security Enhancements: </span>Integrated OAuth, JWT authentication, and rate limiting to
                    safeguard user data.</li>
                <li><span>Automated Deployment: </span>Introduced CI/CD pipelines for faster and more reliable releases.

            <h1 class="title">Step 4: Refining the React Web App</h1>
            <p>The web platform had a disorganized codebase, making it hard to maintain and extend. We revamped it with
                a focus on performance and user experience.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Key Improvements:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Component-Driven Architecture: </span>Refactored UI into reusable React components for
                    consistency and maintainability.</li>
                <li><span>Optimized State Management: </span>Switched from prop-drilling to Redux Toolkit for more
                    predictable state handling.</li>
                <li><span>Responsive Design: </span>Ensured a seamless experience across devices using TailwindCSS and
                    Material UI.</li>
                <li><span>Accessibility & Performance: </span>Implemented lazy loading, server-side rendering, and
                    Lighthouse audits to improve loading speed and SEO.</li>

            <h1 class="title">The Result: A Successful Launch in Record Time</h1>
            <p>Thanks to the architectural improvements and efficient execution, we successfully launched a robust
                mobile app and web platform within 6–8 months. The impact was immediate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Significant Cost Savings: </span>Eliminating reliance on the external agency reduced
                    operational costs drastically.</li>
                <li><span>Improved Performance: </span>App crash rates dropped by over 70%, and API response times
                    improved by 50%.</li>
                <li><span>User Adoption: </span>Post-launch, we saw a steady increase in user registrations and positive
                    feedback from early adopters.</li>
                <li><span>Scalability Achieved: </span>The platform was now built to handle future growth without major
                    rework.

            <h1 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>By taking over Yellow’s technical leadership, I turned around a struggling development process, built a
                high-performing in-house team, and delivered a market-ready solution in under eight months. The
                experience reinforced the importance of hands-on leadership, clean architecture, and rapid execution in
                scaling an early-stage startup. Yellow is now well-positioned to disrupt succession planning in India
                with a digital-first approach.</p>
