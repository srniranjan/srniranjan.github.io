            <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
            <p>YOscar Larson is a company specializing in gas station maintenance and repair services. One of their
                biggest operational challenges was inefficiency in dispatching repair trucks. When a gas station
                required repairs, a technician would visit the site to diagnose the issue, only to realize that the
                necessary tools or parts were missing. This resulted in multiple trips, increasing costs and reducing
                service efficiency.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem, we developed a data-driven predictive system that leveraged Oscar Larson’s legacy
                database of past repairs. Our solution recommended the right parts and tools for each service request,
                reducing unnecessary trips and improving first-time fix rates.</p>

            <h1 class="title">The Challenge: Noisy Legacy Data & Inefficient Dispatches</h1>
            <p>Oscar Larson had a vast but unstructured historical database of past service reports from gas stations.
                However, the data was:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Noisy and Incomplete:</span> Many records had missing or inconsistent part descriptions.</li>
                <li><span>Unstructured: </span>Data entries lacked standardization, with technicians using different
                    terminologies for the same parts.</li>
                <li><span>Not Optimized for Decision-Making:</span> There was no system in place to extract actionable
                    insights from past repairs.</li>
                <li><span>High Burn, Low Output:</span> Despite significant investments, the agency's deliverables were
                    slow, unoptimized, and required constant rework.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal was to clean and structure this data, then build an inference system that could predict the
                required tools and parts based on past repair histories for similar issues.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Data Cleaning & Standardization</h1>
            <p>Before we could use the legacy data effectively, we performed extensive preprocessing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Data Normalization:</span> Standardized part names using NLP-based fuzzy matching to merge
                    duplicates (e.g., “Fuel Pump Assy” vs. “Fuel Pump Assembly”).
                </li>
                <li><span>Handling Missing Data:</span> Implemented an imputation strategy where missing part data was
                    filled based on similar service requests.</li>
                <li><span>Standardizing Technician Notes: </span>Used text classification models to categorize
                    technician notes into predefined issue categories.
                </li>
                <li><span>Outlier Detection: </span>Identified and removed erroneous entries using anomaly detection
                    techniques.

            <h1 class="title">Predictive Inference Algorithm</h1>
            <p>Once the data was structured, we built an inference system that suggested parts and tools based on
                historical patterns. The core algorithm followed these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Feature Engineering: </span>Extracted key attributes from historical repair logs, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Gas station type (e.g., highway vs. urban)</li>
                        <li>Past reported issues</li>
                        <li>Repair frequency</li>
                        <li>Technician-reported symptoms</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span>Similarity Matching: </span>Implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model to find past
                    repairs similar to the new service request.</li>
                <li><span>Probabilistic Recommendations: </span>Used Bayesian inference to predict the most likely
                    required parts based on past repair distributions.</li>
                <li><span>Confidence Scoring: </span>Assigned confidence levels to each part recommendation, helping
                    technicians prioritize what to carry.
                </li>
                <li><span>Continuous Learning:</span> The system improved over time by incorporating feedback from
                    technician confirmations on whether the suggested parts were correct.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>After deploying the solution, Oscar Larson saw significant improvements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>30% Reduction in Unnecessary Trips: </span>Technicians arrived equipped with the correct tools
                    more often.</li>
                <li><span>20% Faster Repair Times: </span>Less downtime at gas stations due to fewer back-and-forth
                    trips.</li>
                <li><span>Increased Technician Efficiency: </span>Reduced frustration and improved job satisfaction
                    among technicians.</li>
                <li><span>Better Data Utilization: </span>Legacy repair data was transformed from a liability into a
                    valuable decision-making tool.</li>

            <p>By leveraging historical repair data and implementing predictive inference models, we transformed how
                Oscar Larson managed service dispatches. The solution not only reduced operational costs but also
                improved service efficiency and customer satisfaction. This case study highlights the power of data
                cleaning, standardization, and intelligent inference in solving real-world logistics and field service
