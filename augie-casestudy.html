            <p>Augie Studio was conceived as a next-generation content creation platform, leveraging AI-driven
                automation to empower creators and businesses. Over three years, I played multiple roles—from a founding
                engineer to building and scaling a team—ensuring that Augie Studio transitioned from an idea to a
                commercially launched product.

            <h1 class="title">The Early Days: Laying the Foundation</h1>
            <p>As a founding engineer, my initial responsibilities revolved around architecting the core platform. We
                aimed to build a system that was scalable, intuitive, and capable of generating high-quality content
                efficiently. The early technology stack was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing us to pivot
                based on user feedback and market demands.</p>
