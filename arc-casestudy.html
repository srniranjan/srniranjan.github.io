            <h1 class="title">Introduction</h1>
            <p>The American Red Cross was facing significant challenges with their chatbot system, which was plagued by
                performance issues, security vulnerabilities, and architectural inefficiencies. Their existing vendor
                was unable to deliver a satisfactory solution, and the strained relationship had left them in a
                difficult position. As an independent contractor, I was brought in to take over the project, form a new
                team, and completely re-architect the chatbot to improve usability, security, and performance.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><span>Non-Performant Chatbot:</span> The chatbot was slow, unreliable, and unable to handle complex
                    interactions effectively.</li>
                <li><span>Security Vulnerabilities:</span> There were major concerns about how the chatbot interfaced
                    with third-party systems like ServiceNow.</li>
                <li><span>Unusable Frontend:</span> The chatbot's front-end implementation in Angular was poorly
                    structured, making it difficult to maintain and use.</li>
                <li><span>Vendor Relationship Breakdown:</span> The previous vendor was unable to deliver results, and
                    the organization needed a rapid intervention.</li>

            <h1 class="title">Solution Approach</h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Building a New Team & Re-Architecting the Chatbot</h2>
            <p>Recognizing the critical nature of the project, I assembled a small but highly skilled team to take over
                development. We focused on the following key improvements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Rewriting the Frontend in Angular:</span> The previous implementation of Angular was
                    unmaintainable and poorly structured. We rewrote the chatbot's frontend to leverage Angular's
                    component-based architecture, improving performance and usability.</li>
                <li><span>Leveraging Microsoft Bot Framework:</span> Instead of building everything from scratch, we
                    utilized Microsoft Bot Framework's built-in capabilities, which provided:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Natural Language Understanding (NLU)</li>
                        <li>Dialog and state management</li>
                        <li>Seamless integration with Azure, which the Red Cross already used</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span>Implementing Turn-Based NLP for Chatbot Conversations:</span> A major rework was needed to
                    ensure the chatbot could handle multi-turn conversations effectively.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subtitle">Advanced NLP for Turn-Based Chatbot Implementation</h2>
            <p>The chatbot needed to handle complex interactions where users could ask follow-up questions or switch
                topics mid-conversation. To achieve this, we implemented:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Intent Recognition:</span> Used pre-trained models and fine-tuned them for the Red Cross’s use
                    cases, ensuring accurate intent detection.</li>
                <li><span>Turn-Based Context Management:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implemented a stateful dialogue manager to track ongoing conversations.</li>
                        <li>Used slot filling techniques to collect necessary information from users dynamically.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><span>Disambiguation Handling:</span> Created a fallback mechanism where the chatbot could clarify
                    ambiguous user inputs before proceeding.</li>
                <li><span>Memory Persistence:</span> Implemented session-based and long-term memory so the chatbot could
                    recall previous interactions and provide more personalized responses.</li>
            </ol>

            <h1 class="title">Enhancing Security for Third-Party Integrations</h1>
            <p>The chatbot needed to interface securely with external systems, especially ServiceNow, which handled
                critical requests. We implemented:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>OAuth 2.0 Authentication: </span>Ensured secure API calls by implementing token-based
                    authentication.</li>
                <li><span>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): </span>Restricted chatbot access based on user roles to
                    prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.</li>
                <li><span>Data Encryption: </span>Used AES-256 encryption for sensitive data transmitted between the
                    chatbot and external systems.</li>
                <li><span>Azure Security Features: </span>Leveraged Azure's security controls, including API gateways,
                    threat detection, and logging mechanisms.</li>

                        <li>The NLP model's accuracy improved, reducing incorrect responses by 40%.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h1 class="title">Conclusion</h1>
            <p>By re-architecting the chatbot, I was able to transform an underperforming and insecure system into a
                robust, scalable, and secure AI assistant. My approach of leveraging the Microsoft Bot Framework,
                implementing advanced NLP techniques, and enforcing strong security practices significantly improved the
                chatbot’s performance and usability. This project not only enhanced the Red Cross’s ability to interact
                with users but also set a new standard for chatbot security and efficiency.</p>
